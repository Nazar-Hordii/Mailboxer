## üìå Introduction

The project, ***Mailboxer*** has been designed as an Account Management System using C++ that allows users to manage their accounts, communicate with other users, view list of received, sent, deleted, starred messages and to search for messages sent to/ received from a user.
<br>
## ‚≠ê Features 
1. Data structures used: Doubly linked list to store user accounts and two singly linked list per user to store sent and received messages. <br>
2. User can create an account, login and send a message to another existing user. <br>
3. Logged-in user can logout and create another account, login to another existing account, change password of an existing account or delete an existing account. <br>
4. User while logged-in in can view list of received, sent, deleted, starred messages and can also search for messages sent to/ received from an user. <br>
5. For every sent/ received message user can read it, delete it, mark it as important (star)/unstar. <br>
6. To display list of messages sent to/ received from an user or list of starred messages in the sent/ received singly linked list, we have used sequential search. <br>
7. Each time we find the message which satisfies the required condition it's reference gets stored in an vector. This vector helps us to read, delete or star/unstar a message in the list which we get as the result of sequential search. Refernces of deleted messages have been stored in a vector (trash). <br>
8. User can either permanently delete message from trash or simply view it.

## ‚≠ê Steps to follow :scroll:

<br>


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Mailboxer](https://github.com/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

<br>


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Mailboxer.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Mailboxer` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Mailboxer
$ cd Mailboxer
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Mailboxer.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Mailboxer.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [Mailboxer](https://github.com/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Mailboxer.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Mailboxer.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Learning-Made-Easy` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https:/pranavkhuranaa/Mailboxer/github.com//pulls).

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the work on your local machine :computer:

To run the code and play with the app on your local machine, do:
* `if os == 'Windows'`:
  * We have tested the code in **Dev C++ IDE** and **Code Blocks IDE** **(Both running MINGW)**.
  * To run the code in any IDE, simply open the file, click `Execute > Run` [Click here for more instructions](http://cs.uno.edu/~jaime/Courses/2025/devCpp2025Instructions.html)
*  `if os == 'Linux or Unix or Mac'`:
   * You need to have `GCC` installed:
   * Go to the folder having the code(.cpp file).
   * Open the terminal, and type : `g++ -o mailboxer mailboxer.cpp`
   * Then run the script by typing : `./mailboxer` 

<br>

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create seperate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a seperate branch for contibution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

<br>


### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Get Featured in the Contributor's List! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Finally, after your pull request has been merged, add another comment below the PR as follows

```sh
@all-contributors please add @<your_username> for <contributions>
```
In contributions, you need to type `code` if you have contributed to the code, or `documentation` if you 
contrubuted for the markdown files.

<!-- ## ‚≠ê Basic Functionalities: -->
<!-- [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-responsibility.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) -->

<!-- To schedule the exams for a very short period of time i.e. 1-2 days for the students who begin to study just before the day of the exam and complete syllabus in a very short time. -->

<!-- To schedule the exam time study for students subject wise who start their studies one or two week before the exams so they complete their syllabus of each subject in time. -->


<!-- To schedule the exam time study for students who begin to study quite early I.e. almost a month ago and have enough time to do everything in the syllabus. Also they have no time issue. -->

## ‚≠ê Algorithm used: -->
<!-- 
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-brains.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Fractional Knapsack Algorithm: Fractional Knapsack algorithm is used in order to find the chapters to be done on the basis of their weightage so as to maximize marks in limited amount of time.

Job Scheduling Algorithm: This algorithm is implemented so that the user inputs the subjects he/she has to study with the date of exams of the respective subjects and respective priorities. So they get the sequence of subjects as ouput for effective ways of study and managing time.

## ‚≠ê Real Life Application: 
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/makes-people-smile.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) <br>
A most common problem faced by students during exams is of time management and its utilization.It can help students to effectively manage their time during exams by giving them a sequence in which the should study in order to maximize marks.
